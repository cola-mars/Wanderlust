## Details
This applications uses asynchronous HTTP GET fetch requests to recieve relavent information about the locations they are searching for.

## Usage
In order to use the app, a client ID, secret, and API key need to be provided for foursquare functionality. An OpenWeather API key is necessary for weather fetch requests. 
**note:** To maintain saftey and privacy, API keys and things of that nature have been removed from the front-end code.

### Recent changes
- May 6, 2022: Foursquare recently changed the API request for handling places. API calls within this application have been updated to provide the most up to date functionality to the user experience.
